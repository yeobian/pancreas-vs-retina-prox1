# Prox1 â€“ Regeneration Suppressor Analysis

This project explores the gene **Prox1** as a potential global regeneration suppressor, not just in the retina (as shown in existing literature), but also in the pancreas and other tissues using single-cell RNA-seq data.

## Goals
- Analyze Prox1 co-expression patterns in retina vs pancreas
- Identify top co-expressed genes
- Suggest new therapeutic targets
- Compare Prox1 expression by tissue and age

## Tools
- Python, Scanpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, gProfiler

## Data Sources
- GSE135922 (Retina)
- Tabula Sapiens (Pancreas)
- GTEx (Human tissue expression & age info)
